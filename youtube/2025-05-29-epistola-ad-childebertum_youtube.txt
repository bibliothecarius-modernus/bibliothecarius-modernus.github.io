Translated from Patrologia Latina volume 68, listed under the title: "Epistola ad Childebertum".

"Epistola ad Childebertum," written by Leo of Sens around 537-538, is a letter addressed to King Childebert I of the Franks, urging him to uphold Christian values and moral governance. In the context of post-Roman Gaul, the work reflects the challenges of maintaining ecclesiastical authority and social order amid the political fragmentation and cultural transitions of the early medieval period. Leo's correspondence emphasizes the importance of the monarchy's role in supporting the Church and promoting justice, highlighting the intertwining of religious and political life during this era.

Key features include:
- Emphasis on the authority of the Church and its leaders in guiding the faithful.
- Discussion of the relationship between the Church and secular power, particularly in the context of governance.
- Exploration of the nature of ecclesiastical unity and the importance of maintaining doctrinal consistency among believers.

The "Epistola ad Childebertum," a letter attributed to the early Christian theologian and bishop Gregory of Tours, is significant for understanding early Christianity as it provides insight into the theological debates, ecclesiastical politics, and the relationship between the church and the Merovingian monarchy during the 6th century. This correspondence illustrates how early Christian leaders navigated the complexities of faith and governance, reflecting the broader dynamics of Christianization in post-Roman Gaul.

Archive.org Metadata Description:

The Epistola ad Childebertum is a letter written by Leo, Archbishop of Sens, to King Childebert I of Paris around 537-538 CE during the Merovingian period in Gaul. The work emerged from a specific ecclesiastical-political conflict in which King Childebert attempted to create a new episcopal see at Melun, a city that belonged politically to his kingdom but ecclesiastically to Leo's Diocese of Sens. The letter represents Leo's response to this territorial challenge, which threatened to dismember his diocese by carving out Melun as a separate bishopric. The historical context reflects the broader administrative chaos that followed the division of Clovis's kingdom among his four sons in 511, which fragmented old Roman civitates and ecclesiastical provinces across different political realms, often leaving metropolitans without authority over suffragan dioceses that fell under other kings' rule. The primary themes of the work center on the tension between royal authority and episcopal jurisdiction, the preservation of traditional ecclesiastical boundaries, and the complex negotiations required to maintain church unity amid political fragmentation. The letter holds scholarly significance as a primary source documenting the practical challenges faced by the Merovingian church in maintaining institutional coherence across divided kingdoms, illustrating the ongoing struggle between secular and ecclesiastical powers in post-Roman Gaul, and providing insight into the administrative and territorial disputes that characterized early medieval
