Archive.org Metadata Description:

De Spiritus Sancti Potentia is a fourth-century theological treatise attributed to St. Nicetas of Remesiana, a bishop in the Roman province of Dacia who lived from approximately 335 to 414 CE. The work forms part of the third book in a series of six instructional texts that Nicetas composed for catechumens preparing for baptism, as recorded by the fifth-century writer Gennadius of Marseilles. Written during a period of significant Christian expansion into barbarian territories, the treatise reflects Nicetas's missionary context, as he was actively engaged in converting Gothic and Dacian peoples in the northern frontier regions of the Roman Empire. The work focuses on pneumatological doctrine, specifically examining the power and nature of the Holy Spirit within Trinitarian theology, and is often paired in manuscripts with another short work titled De ratione fidei as complementary instructional material. The treatise addresses fundamental questions of Christian belief concerning the divine majesty and the role of the Holy Spirit in the economy of salvation. Scholarly significance lies in its representation of late fourth-century catechetical instruction in frontier Christian communities, its contribution to early pneumatological discourse, and its documentation of the systematic theological education provided to new converts during a crucial period of Christian expansion beyond the traditional boundaries of the Roman world.
