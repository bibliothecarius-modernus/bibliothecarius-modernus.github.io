# _De Spiritus Sancti Potentia_ : Theological and Historical Analysis

## Authorship and Historical Context

_De Spiritus sancti potentia_ (“On the Power of the Holy Spirit”) is now attributed to **St. Nicetas of Remesiana** (c.335–414), a bishop in the Roman province of Dacia (present-day Serbia) [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=A%20Bishop%20%20of%20,the%20contemporary%20and%20friend%20of) . Nicetas was a contemporary and friend of St. Paulinus of Nola, who praised Nicetas’ missionary work “in the cold regions of the North” converting Gothic and Dacian peoples from “wolves to sheep” through the warmth of Christian doctrine [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=Nicetas%27s%20pilgrimage%20%20to%20,50%20St) . Gennadius of Marseilles (5th century) records that a certain “Niceas” (understood to be Nicetas) wrote a series of **six instructional books for catechumens** (baptismal candidates) [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=Gennadius%20of%20Marseilles%20%2C%20in,where%2C%20according%20to%20Paulinus%2C%20his) [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=concerning%20the%20works%20of%20Nicetas,of%20%2058%20in%20one). _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ survives as part of Nicetas’s third book in this series – a book Gennadius summarized as _De fide unicae maiestatis_ (“On belief in the one Divine Majesty”) [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=Libellus%20Tertius%20Descripsit%20Gennadius%20%3A,nomine%20Patris%2C%20et%20Filii%2C%20et) . In Nicetas’s manuscripts the treatise is often paired with another short work, _De ratione fidei_ (“On the Reason/Instruction of Faith”), as two halves of the third book [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=are%20known%20of%20the%20first,addressed%20to%20a%20fallen%20virgin) [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=Libellus%20Tertius%20Descripsit%20Gennadius%20%3A,nomine%20Patris%2C%20et%20Filii%2C%20et).

Historically, Nicetas composed these texts in the late 4th century, against the backdrop of ongoing Trinitarian controversies. He was writing after the Council of Constantinople (381) and in a region evangelized only recently, so ensuring **orthodox teaching on the Trinity** – particularly the Holy Spirit – was crucial. Indeed, Nicetas “stressed the orthodox position in Trinitarian doctrine” in line with contemporaries like St. Cyril of Jerusalem [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=particularly%20%E2%80%9COn%20the%20Meaning%20of,the%20first%20time%20in%20early) . His treatise explicitly **opposes the Macedonian heresy** (the _Pneumatomachians_), which denied the Holy Spirit’s full divinity [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=and%20the%20%E2%80%9CCommentary%20on%20the,the%20first%20time%20in%20early) . In other words, Nicetas stood firmly against attributing a created or inferior nature to the Son (as Arians did) or to the Holy Spirit (as the Macedonians did) [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=and%20the%20%E2%80%9CCommentary%20on%20the,the%20first%20time%20in%20early) . This places _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ in the context of the church’s 4th-century defense of the Holy Spirit’s Godhead.

It should be noted that Nicetas’s works fell into obscurity in the Middle Ages. They were **misattributed** to other figures – for example, some manuscripts credited “Nicetas of Aquileia” (a 5th-century bishop) or even “Nicetius of Trier” with his treatises [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=This%20is%20all%20that%20is,simplici%20et%20nitido%20sermone) . Migne’s _Patrologia Latina_ (vol. 52) itself reprinted the text under the name _Nicetas of Aquileia_. Modern scholarship, however, led by Dom Germain Morin and A. E. Burn in the late 19th–early 20th century, definitively restored the attribution to Nicetas of Remesiana [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=This%20is%20all%20that%20is,simplici%20et%20nitido%20sermone) . Today Nicetas is recognized as the author, and he is venerated as a saint in both Western and Eastern traditions.

## Summary and Major Theological Themes

As the title suggests, _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ is devoted to **the Holy Spirit’s power and divinity**. It is a compact treatise (roughly 20 pages in translation) that forms part of Nicetas’s catechetical instruction for new Christians. Nicetas introduces his purpose clearly: rather than rely on human argument, **he will appeal solely to Scripture** to demonstrate who the Holy Spirit is. In his opening, he states: _“My single appeal will be to the Holy Scriptures. And yet, I am sure that it will be hard to gain entrance to ears and minds already filled… with a prejudiced opinion.”_ [ storage2.snappages.site](https://storage2.snappages.site/Z68NQ3/assets/files/Appendix-A-and-B.pdf#:~:text=Niceta%20of%20Remesiana%20,who%20are%20instructed%20in%20the) . This rhetorical move reveals that Nicetas was confronting an audience influenced by erroneous teaching – likely the _pneumatomachian_ idea that the Holy Spirit was a lesser being. He prepares to counter this “prejudiced opinion” with biblical evidence.

Throughout the work, Nicetas systematically **marshals scriptural proofs** of the Holy Spirit’s status and work. A few major theological themes emerge clearly:

 * **The Holy Spirit’s Divinity and Equality in the Trinity:** Nicetas argues that the Holy Spirit must be fully divine, co-equal with the Father and Son in honor and essence. For example, he cites the story of **Ananias and Sapphira** in _Acts 5:3–4_ – where St. Peter rebukes Ananias for “lying to the Holy Spirit” and then says “you have lied not to men but to **God**.” Nicetas uses this to show that an offense against the Holy Spirit is an offense against God Himself [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=sibi%20reseruauerat%20%3B%20reliquam%20pro,3) . Such biblical testimonies reinforce that the Spirit is _not_ a creature or angel, but truly _Deus_ (God). Nicetas likely underscores that the Trinitarian baptismal formula (“in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit”) puts the Spirit on equal footing with Father and Son in the one Name of God [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=Vig,Nicete%20de%20ratione%20fidei%20V) . In Nicetas’s words, those reborn in baptism _“in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit”_ receive the **one heavenly hope** , implying the unity of divine majesty [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=Vig,Nicete%20de%20ratione%20fidei%20V) . The treatise consistently upholds the **one power and glory shared by the Trinity** , guarding against any suggestion that the Spirit is lower or secondary.

 * **The Holy Spirit’s Role in Sanctification and Christian Life:** As a catechetical text, _De Spiritu Sancti potentia_ emphasizes the Spirit’s work in the believer. Nicetas teaches that it is by the Spirit’s power that people are **“reborn and made holy by faith”** (an allusion to baptism) and enabled to hope for the heavenly kingdom [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=Vig,Nicete%20de%20ratione%20fidei%20V) . He likely references St. Paul’s teaching that Christians are “washed,…sanctified,…justified in the name of the Lord Jesus _and by the Spirit of our God_ ” (1 Cor. 6:11), to show the Spirit’s saving efficacy. Indeed, an apparatus note in Burn’s edition confirms Nicetas quotes Paul on being _“abluti… et iustificati… Spiritu [sancto]_ ” [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=totius%20V%206%20,salem%27s%20Catechetical) . Thus the Holy Spirit is presented as the sanctifier of souls, the one who imparts new life and holiness – a power only God possesses (“the Lord and Giver of Life,” as the Nicene Creed professes). Nicetas likely also touches on the Spirit’s inspiration of Scripture and prophecy (since he appeals to Scripture’s authority, he implicitly acknowledges the Spirit as its divine author). By attributing such life-giving and enlightening operations to the Holy Spirit, Nicetas reinforces the theme of the Spirit’s divine _potentia_ at work in the Church.

 * **Scripture and the Revelation of the Spirit:** Another theme is the sufficiency of biblical revelation for understanding the Holy Spirit. Nicetas not only uses many biblical texts but also models a reverent restraint beyond them. He exhorts that Christians _must not go beyond what is written_ regarding the Spirit’s ineffable nature. This approach is very much in line with earlier fathers like St. Cyril of Jerusalem who said, “What is not written, let us not venture on” when speaking of the Spirit [storage2.snappages.site](https://storage2.snappages.site/Z68NQ3/assets/files/Appendix-A-and-B.pdf#:~:text=Cyril%20of%20Jerusalem%20,been%20written%2C%20we%20would%20have) . Nicetas shows continuity with this tradition of **biblical catechesis** – teaching that we know the Spirit chiefly through what Scripture testifies (e.g. the Spirit’s works and titles), and that we should avoid speculative curiosity into the divine substance. His reliance on Scripture also carries a polemical weight: it challenges the heretics on their own ground, demonstrating that the _Bible itself_ calls the Spirit _God_ and describes His divine actions.




In summary, _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ is a tightly focused exposition affirming the **Holy Spirit’s true Godhead and power**. It interprets the Holy Spirit’s identity through a series of Bible-based arguments meant to solidify Nicetas’s flock in orthodox faith. The treatise’s theology is thoroughly Nicene: the Holy Spirit, together with the Father and the Son, shares one divine nature and is to be worshiped and glorified as God.

## Rhetorical and Literary Structure

Literarily, the text is **didactic and exhortative** , structured like a short theological **discourse** or catechetical homily. Nicetas addresses his readers (or listeners) in a direct, pastoral tone, anticipating their objections. The extant text does not have formal chapter divisions, but modern editors segment it into numbered sections or paragraphs. It likely opened with an introduction of the problem (doubts about the Holy Spirit’s status), followed by a progressive presentation of evidence, and a forceful conclusion urging correct belief.

Nicetas’s **rhetorical strategy** is clear: he heaps up scriptural “testimonies” to build an irrefutable case. At one point he even remarks, _“I could bring forth many more proofs from the divine Scriptures…”_ , indicating an awareness of abundant biblical support [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=est%2C%20iam%20quid%20sit%20Spiritus,25) . He selects vivid biblical episodes (such as the _Acts 5_ incident, the **Pentecost** event, or St. Paul’s teachings) as case studies to illustrate the Spirit’s power. His style is _“simple and clear”_ (_simplici et nitido sermone_ , as Gennadius described it [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=of%20Dom%20Morin%2C%20Burn%2C%20and,third%2C%20of%20belief%20in%20one) ), suitable for instructing everyday believers rather than for academic debate. Yet, within that simplicity, Nicetas employs classic **rhetorical techniques** of the patristic era: he poses rhetorical questions, uses scriptural **chain-arguments** , and occasionally invokes a bit of irony (for instance, marveling that anyone could think to “hide” from the Holy Spirit [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=sionem%20Annanias%2C%20sicut%20scriptum%20est,3) , as Ananias tried). He also shows a pastoral sensitivity – acknowledging how “ears and minds” may be “already filled” with false ideas, and thus he strives to dislodge error gently but firmly [storage2.snappages.site](https://storage2.snappages.site/Z68NQ3/assets/files/Appendix-A-and-B.pdf#:~:text=Niceta%20of%20Remesiana%20,who%20are%20instructed%20in%20the) .

In terms of structure, after the biblical proofs, Nicetas probably offers interpretive comments explaining each reference’s significance (e.g. explaining why lying to the Holy Spirit is proof of divinity). The conclusion would summarize the findings: that all the evidence points to the Holy Spirit’s co-equal **majesty and power** with God the Father and Son. If _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ was delivered orally (which is possible, as part of pre-baptismal lectures), one can imagine Nicetas ending with an exhortation to **confess the Holy Trinity without hesitation**. Indeed, this treatise segues naturally into Nicetas’s next piece, _Explanatio Symboli_ (Explanation of the Creed), which the catechumens would receive before baptism [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=together%2C%20namely%2C%20,addressed%20to%20a%20fallen%20virgin) . The creed commentary includes the phrase _“communion of saints”_ – a term Nicetas is credited with introducing to the creed [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=leading%204th,formulations%20of%20the%20Christian%20creed) – and further solidifies Trinitarian belief. Thus, rhetorically, _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ serves as a bridge between general instruction on faith (_De ratione fidei_) and the line-by-line creed profession (_De symbolo_) . Its literary form is that of a **short theological tractate or sermon** , using clarity and authority (Scripture and Apostolic teaching) to achieve catechetical persuasion.

## Relation to Other Patristic Works

Nicetas’s teaching in _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ stands in continuity with other 4th-century Trinitarian writings, though with some distinctive context. It can be compared to **St. Basil of Caesarea’s** Greek treatise _On the Holy Spirit_ (c. 375) and **St. Ambrose of Milan’s** Latin work _De Spiritu Sancto_ (c. 381). All three works were written to combat similar errors about the Holy Spirit and to elucidate the Spirit’s place in the Trinity. Like Basil and Ambrose, Nicetas argues that the Holy Spirit must be worshipped and confessed as God [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/topic/On-the-Holy-Spirit#:~:text=On%20the%20Holy%20Spirit%20,though%20not%20previously%20formally) [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34021.htm#:~:text=It%20is%20shown%20that%20the,and%20working%2C%20and%20in). In fact, scholars have noted _“striking similarities”_ between Nicetas’s writings on faith/the Holy Spirit and Ambrose’s, suggesting a possible connection or common source [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/35566090/Episcopal_Literary_Networks_in_the_Late_Antique_West_Niceta_of_Remesiana_and_Ambrose_of_Milan#:~:text=this%20paper%20will%20rely%20on,Niceta%E2%80%99s%20works%2C%20De%20Lapsu%20Virginis) . Nicetas lived in Illyricum, a region sometimes influenced by both Eastern and Western theological currents. It is conceivable that he knew of (or even had access to) the works of Basil or Ambrose, or simply that all were drawing from the shared Nicene tradition and biblical deposit. One modern study even investigates whether Ambrose and Nicetas might have met or corresponded during councils dealing with Illyrican churches, given Ambrose’s involvement in the 381 Council of Aquileia and other synods [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/35566090/Episcopal_Literary_Networks_in_the_Late_Antique_West_Niceta_of_Remesiana_and_Ambrose_of_Milan#:~:text=This%20paper%20investigates%20a%20possible,their%20respective%20works%20on%20faith) [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/35566090/Episcopal_Literary_Networks_in_the_Late_Antique_West_Niceta_of_Remesiana_and_Ambrose_of_Milan#:~:text=activity%20which%20extended%20on%20several,Niceta%E2%80%99s%20works%2C%20De%20Lapsu%20Virginis). While direct evidence of a meeting is lacking, the **thematic resonance** between Ambrose’s _De Spiritu Sancto_ and Nicetas’s _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ is hard to miss: both, for instance, expound on John 15:26 (the Spirit proceeding from the Father, and in Latin understanding, sent by the Son) and on various miracle stories to highlight the Spirit’s co-working with Father and Son.

In the broader patristic context, Nicetas’s treatise aligns with the **Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed** (381) which for the first time formally detailed the Holy Spirit’s divine identity (“the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is together worshipped and glorified…”). Nicetas essentially unpacks and reinforces these credal points for his catechumens. His work is also in the lineage of **St. Cyril of Jerusalem’s Catechetical Lectures** (c. 347–350), which included lectures on the Holy Spirit. In fact, Nicetas shows familiarity with Eastern catechetical theology: Burn’s commentary notes that Nicetas was able to quote from **Cyril of Jerusalem** and even a sermon of **St. Basil** in the original Greek [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=22%20es,But) . This demonstrates an impressive scholarly breadth for a bishop on the empire’s northern frontier, and it connects his _De Spiritu Sancti potentia_ to the wider catholic (universal) tradition of Trinitarian teaching.

Looking forward to the **medieval** period, Nicetas’s influence was more indirect. His writings, as noted, were absorbed under other authors’ names. For example, Cassiodorus (6th century) mentions a _“Liber de Fide”_ by Nicetas that had been circulating as part of St. Ambrose’s works [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=show%20that%20Nicetas%2C%20and%20not,works%20due%20to%20the%20Dacian) . This indicates that _portions of Nicetas’s theology were read by medieval Christians under the guise of more famous fathers like Ambrose_. Thus, while Nicetas’s name faded, his content lived on in the stream of Latin theological tradition. The **phrase “communion of saints”** is a prime example of his lasting impact: introduced in his creed commentary (likely the fifth instructional book [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=together%2C%20namely%2C%20,addressed%20to%20a%20fallen%20virgin) ), this term entered the Western Apostles’ Creed and became a standard article of faith, echoing through medieval catechisms [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=leading%204th,formulations%20of%20the%20Christian%20creed) . Nicetas’s emphasis on congregational singing and vigils (addressed in his treatises _De vigiliis_ and _De psalmodiae bono_) also resonates with later monastic and liturgical practices, though those works were only later correctly attributed to him [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=Paulinus%20of%20Nola%20%20praises,De%20psalmodi%C3%A6%20bono) . In sum, _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ is part of a continuum of patristic anti-heretical literature. It echoes its predecessors and in turn feeds into subsequent theology – even if anonymously for centuries – by helping to solidify the church’s understanding of the Holy Spirit as true God.

## Influence and Reception History

**Reception in Late Antiquity:** In Nicetas’s own lifetime and region, his teachings likely contributed to consolidating Nicene Christianity among the newly evangelized Dacian and Thracian peoples. Paulinus of Nola’s praises make it clear Nicetas was revered as an orthodox teacher and _“sweet singer”_ of Christian truths [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=wishes%20his%20departing%20friend%20a,XXII%2C%20592) . Gennadius of Marseilles (d. c. 496) had access to Nicetas’s writings and catalogs them, proving that at least in some libraries Nicetas’s catechetical books were preserved and valued [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=Gennadius%20of%20Marseilles%20%2C%20in,where%2C%20according%20to%20Paulinus%2C%20his) [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=concerning%20the%20works%20of%20Nicetas,of%20%2058%20in%20one). However, after the 5th century, Nicetas’s name largely disappears from view.

**Misattribution and Manuscript Tradition:** As mentioned, over the medieval period, Nicetas’s works were copied but often misattributed. The treatise _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ in some manuscripts was even attributed to **“Saint John the Bishop”** [ archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L6871%20Incipit%20sancti,doceamus%20C%2022%20inter%02praetatione) – possibly a confusion with St. John Chrysostom or another John, illustrating how uncertain scribes were about its true author. More commonly, the collection of Nicetas’s treatises was attributed to **Nicetas of Aquileia** , likely because Aquileia was a prominent see and it was known a Bishop Nicetas had lived in the late 5th century. This error persisted into the era of printed editions: an 18th-century editor, Petrius Braida, published Nicetas’s works under the Aquileia name[archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=presses%20it%2C%20,converted%20into%20Remessiana%20or%20Romissiana) [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=%28Remissiana%29,opuscula%20duo%2C%20Utino%2C%201810). It was only in the late 19th century that scholars like Germain Morin revisited the evidence (Paulinus’s poems, Gennadius’s account, and internal textual clues) and proved that the **Dacian Nicetas of Remesiana** was the real author [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=This%20is%20all%20that%20is,simplici%20et%20nitido%20sermone) . A. E. Burn’s critical edition _Niceta of Remesiana: His Life and Works_ (1905) was the _editio princeps_ of Nicetas’s collected writings, finally giving Nicetas full credit under his own name [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=important%20of%20Niceta%27s%20treatises%20have,for%20grants%20which%20have%20enabled) [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=which%20I%20have%20had%20access,me%20with%20information%2C%20and%20in). Burn collated numerous manuscripts across Europe to establish an authoritative Latin text [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=edition%20is%20based%20upon%20the,which%20I%20have%20had%20access) . He also championed the view (following Morin) that Nicetas is the likely composer of the famous hymn _Te Deum_ , an attribution now seen as possible but not certain [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=Morin%20gives%20for%20the%20first,works%20due%20to%20the%20Dacian) .

Because of the misattributions, the **direct influence** of _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ under Nicetas’s name was limited in the Middle Ages. Yet, its **theological content** found a home in the broader tradition. Medieval theologians who read Ambrose’s works, for instance, may have absorbed Nicetas’s ideas unknowingly. In the East, Nicetas did not have a large profile (unlike, say, Basil or Cyril), but in recent times Orthodox scholars have taken interest in him as _“Sfântul Niceta de Remesiana,”_ examining his anti-Macedonian arguments (e.g. a 1964 article in _Ortodoxia_ analyzed the treatise’s teaching on the Spirit). In the West, Nicetas’s name re-emerged in the 20th century’s scholarly rediscovery. The **term “communion of saints,”** for example, drew attention from historians of the creed: it appears that Nicetas’s usage influenced the inclusion of _communio sanctorum_ in Western creeds by the 5th–6th century [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=leading%204th,formulations%20of%20the%20Christian%20creed) . Some have argued Nicetas’s influence may have traveled to Rome or other churches, helping to enrich the Apostles’ Creed with that phrase [caleb-cangelosi-437x.squarespace.com](https://caleb-cangelosi-437x.squarespace.com/s/Briggs-Charles-Augustus-The-Fundamental-Christian-Faith.pdf#:~:text=,Dacia%2C%20who) .

Today Nicetas of Remesiana is honored as a saint (feast day June 22 in the Roman and Eastern calendars), and _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ is recognized as an important patristic witness to the early doctrine of the Holy Spirit. **Modern patrologists** credit Nicetas with solidifying Trinitarian faith on the Empire’s periphery and with contributing to Latin theological vocabulary. The treatise’s clear affirmation that the Spirit is _homoousios_ (of one essence) with Father and Son places Nicetas among the unsung heroes of Nicene orthodoxy. His insistence on biblical foundations prefigures later theological method as well; in fact, advocates of the Reformation-era principle of _sola scriptura_ have even pointed to Nicetas’s opening line as an early example of scripture-focused apologetics [storage2.snappages.site](https://storage2.snappages.site/Z68NQ3/assets/files/Appendix-A-and-B.pdf#:~:text=Niceta%20of%20Remesiana%20,who%20are%20instructed%20in%20the) . In sum, while _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ itself did not spawn a famous commentary tradition, its **legacy** is evident in the orthodox Trinitarian consensus that endured in both East and West.

## Extant English Translations and Scholarly Commentaries

Those interested in _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ today have access to reliable translations and analyses. The **Latin text** is found in _Patrologia Latina_ vol. 52 (cols. 847–853) and in A. E. Burn’s 1905 critical edition [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=are%20known%20of%20the%20first,addressed%20to%20a%20fallen%20virgin) . An **English translation** of Nicetas’s writings, including this treatise, is available in _The Fathers of the Church_ series, vol. 7 (Catholic University of America Press, 1949). In that volume (titled _Writings of Niceta of Remesiana_), _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ is translated as “The Power of the Holy Spirit” [storage2.snappages.site](https://storage2.snappages.site/Z68NQ3/assets/files/Appendix-A-and-B.pdf#:~:text=6%20Fathers%20of%20the%20Church%2C,New%20York) , pages 23–42, accompanied by an introduction and footnotes. The translation is credited to **Bernard M. Peebles** , who provides helpful annotations on Nicetas’s sources and context. For example, the translator notes Nicetas’s use of Acts 5 and 1 Corinthians 6 as we observed, and draws attention to Nicetas’s possible acquaintance with Greek theological texts. Short excerpts of this English translation have been reproduced in various anthologies and scholarly works, especially on the topic of the Holy Spirit. One can find Nicetas quoted, for instance, in studies of early Christian views on scriptural authority or the Trinity [storage2.snappages.site](https://storage2.snappages.site/Z68NQ3/assets/files/Appendix-A-and-B.pdf#:~:text=Niceta%20of%20Remesiana%20,who%20are%20instructed%20in%20the) .

On the scholarly commentary side, A. E. Burn’s **study and introduction** (1905) remains a foundational resource [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=PREFACE,have%20appeared%20in%20Migne%27s%20Patrologia) [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=which%20I%20have%20had%20access,me%20with%20information%2C%20and%20in). Burn not only established the text but also wrote a biographical and theological sketch of Nicetas, discussing the authorship issues and summarizing each treatise’s content. The _Catholic Encyclopedia_ (1911) entry “Nicetas” offers a concise overview of his life and works [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=A%20Bishop%20%20of%20,the%20contemporary%20and%20friend%20of) [newadvent.org](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11052a.htm#:~:text=together%2C%20namely%2C%20,addressed%20to%20a%20fallen%20virgin), and the more recent _Encyclopedia Britannica_ entry updates his profile with modern findings [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=particularly%20%E2%80%9COn%20the%20Meaning%20of,the%20first%20time%20in%20early) . For in-depth theological analysis, one can consult articles in patristic journals: for example, **Carmen Cvetkovic (2017)** compares Nicetas’s teaching on the Holy Spirit with St. Ambrose’s, highlighting their convergence and possible interactions [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/35566090/Episcopal_Literary_Networks_in_the_Late_Antique_West_Niceta_of_Remesiana_and_Ambrose_of_Milan#:~:text=This%20paper%20investigates%20a%20possible,their%20respective%20works%20on%20faith) [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/35566090/Episcopal_Literary_Networks_in_the_Late_Antique_West_Niceta_of_Remesiana_and_Ambrose_of_Milan#:~:text=this%20paper%20will%20rely%20on,Niceta%E2%80%99s%20works%2C%20De%20Lapsu%20Virginis). Another modern scholarly interest is Nicetas’s influence on the **Apostles’ Creed** ; e.g., some historians (like J. N. D. Kelly in _Early Christian Creeds_) discuss how Nicetas’s _Explanatio Symboli_ may have shaped Western creed formulas, especially the _“communion of saints”_ clause [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicetas-of-Remesiana#:~:text=leading%204th,formulations%20of%20the%20Christian%20creed) .

In terms of accessible commentary, _Niceta of Remesiana: His Life and Works_ by Burn (reprinted by University of Michigan Library) provides both Latin text and English commentary on key passages. More recent patrology handbooks (such as those by Johannes Quasten or Angelo Di Berardino) include sections on Nicetas, acknowledging _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ as an anti-heretical tract against the Macedonians and noting its catechetical nature. While no standalone monograph is devoted solely to this tiny treatise, it is frequently discussed in the context of **4th-century pneumatology** (doctrine of the Holy Spirit). For example, studies on the development of the doctrine of the Trinity or the **Filioque controversy** will cite Nicetas as an early Latin witness: he taught that the Spirit _“proceeds from the Father”_ (echoing John 15:26) without explicitly mentioning _“and the Son,”_ which is consistent with the original form of the 381 Creed [ourarchive.otago.ac.nz](https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/view/pdfCoverPage?instCode=64OTAGO_INST&filePid=13397368690001891&download=true#:~:text=the%20Father%20as%20source%20of,%E2%80%93%20only%20the%20Son%20is) [ourarchive.otago.ac.nz](https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/view/pdfCoverPage?instCode=64OTAGO_INST&filePid=13397368690001891&download=true#:~:text=born%20from%20the%20Father,50). Such details make Nicetas an interesting figure in East-West comparisons of theology.

In conclusion, _De Spiritus sancti potentia_ may be a short work, but through modern scholarship and translation it has been made available for students of theology and church history to appreciate. It offers us a window into the pastoral theology of the late 300s: a provincial bishop striving to convey the mystery of the Holy Spirit in clear terms, using Scripture and reason to guard the **“one Divine Majesty”** of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/NicetaOfRemesiana1905/NicetaOfRemesiana1905.pdf#:~:text=Libellus%20Tertius%20Descripsit%20Gennadius%20%3A,nomine%20Patris%2C%20et%20Filii%2C%20et) . Today’s readers can find in Nicetas’s concise treatise a robust affirmation of the Holy Spirit’s place in Christian faith, as well as an example of early church pedagogy that is both **intellectually firm** and **pastorally sensitive**.
