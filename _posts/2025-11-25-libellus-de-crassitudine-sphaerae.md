A remarkable 11th-century mathematical treatise in which Bishop Adelbold of Utrecht presents his derivation of sphere volume to Pope Sylvester II, the famous "Mathematician Pope," revealing the sophisticated transmission of Greek mathematical knowledge through medieval cathedral schools.

## 1. The Author: Adelbold II of Utrecht (c. 975 - 1026)

### Biography and Education

Adelbold (also spelled Adalbold) was a medieval scholar, mathematician, and churchman who became Bishop of Utrecht from 1010 until his death on November 27, 1026. Born around 975, probably in the Low Countries, he received his education at the famous cathedral school of Liège under Bishop Notker (Notger), which was one of the most renowned centers of learning in medieval Europe.

The Liège school under Notker was exceptional—students flocked there "from all Christendom." Adelbold studied alongside other notable scholars like Heriger of Lobbes and was exposed to the **quadrivium** (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). This mathematical training would later manifest in his scholarly correspondence with Gerbert of Aurillac.

### Career and Achievements

- Became a canon and teacher at Laubach
- Served as chaplain and notary to Emperor Henry II
- Appointed Bishop of Utrecht in 1010 with the emperor's support
- Completed the great Romanesque Cathedral of Saint Martin at Utrecht
- Introduced Cluniac monastic reform to his diocese through Poppo of Stablo
- Expanded the territorial possessions of the diocese, acquiring Drente (1024) and Teisterbant (1026)

As bishop, Adelbold faced military challenges including Norman raids and conflicts with neighboring nobles. He was defeated at the Battle of Vlaardingen (1018) against Dirk III, Count of Holland, in a dispute over the Merwede district.

## 2. The Recipient: Pope Sylvester II (Gerbert of Aurillac, c. 946 - 1003)

### The "Mathematician Pope"

Gerbert of Aurillac was one of the most brilliant minds of the medieval period. Born in Aquitaine around 946, he studied at the monastery of Santa María de Ripoll in Catalonia, where he encountered Arabic mathematical and astronomical learning. He later studied in Barcelona, Seville, and Córdoba.

### Mathematical Achievements

- Reintroduced the abacus to Western Europe
- Brought Arabic numerals to European attention
- Constructed astronomical instruments including armillary spheres
- Corresponded with scholars across Europe on mathematical problems
- His letter to Adelbold on calculating the area of equilateral triangles is famous

### Career

Gerbert served as:
- Master at the Cathedral School of Reims
- Abbot of Bobbio
- Archbishop of Reims (991-997)
- Archbishop of Ravenna (998)
- Pope Sylvester II (999-1003)

He was the first French pope, and the papal name "Sylvester" was chosen to recall Sylvester I, who had worked alongside Emperor Constantine—Gerbert similarly worked alongside Emperor Otto III.

## 3. The Text: Mathematical Content

### Title and Meaning

The Latin title *Libellus de Ratione Inveniendi Crassitudinem Sphaerae* translates to "A Little Book on the Method of Finding the Thickness (Volume) of a Sphere." The term **crassitudo** literally means "thickness" or "solidity" but in medieval mathematical Latin denoted volume or cubic content.

### The Mathematical Problem

This treatise represents a continuation of the mathematical correspondence between Adelbold and Gerbert. The text shows Adelbold seeking verification of his calculations from the most respected mathematical authority of the age—who happened to be the Pope.

The treatise addresses the classical problem of finding the volume of a sphere, building on Archimedes' work. Key mathematical elements include:

1. **The Approximation of π**: Adelbold uses π ≈ 22/7 (the Archimedean approximation), stating that a circle with diameter 7 has circumference 22.

2. **Area Calculation**: He calculates the area of a circle using the formula: Area = (diameter/2) × (circumference/2), yielding 38.5 for a circle of diameter 7.

3. **The Cube-Sphere Relationship**: The core problem involves inscribing a sphere within a cube and determining what fraction of the cube's volume the sphere occupies.

4. **The 11/21 Ratio**: Adelbold arrives at the sphere being approximately 11/21 of the cube's volume—meaning 10/21 must be "cut away" from the cube to leave the sphere.

### Mathematical Significance

The actual ratio of sphere to cube volume (where the sphere is inscribed in the cube) is π/6 ≈ 0.5236. Using π ≈ 22/7, this gives approximately 11/21 ≈ 0.5238—remarkably close! This shows sophisticated understanding of the relationship.

## 4. Historical Significance

### The Transmission of Classical Mathematics

This text is important evidence for:

1. The survival and transmission of **Archimedean mathematics** in medieval Europe
2. The role of cathedral schools (Liège, Reims) in preserving mathematical knowledge
3. The intellectual network connecting scholars across medieval Christendom
4. The practical application of Greek mathematical theory in the 11th century

### The Gerbert Circle

Adelbold was part of a network of scholars who corresponded with Gerbert, including:
- Heriger of Lobbes
- Richer of Saint-Remy
- Robert II of France (Gerbert's former student)

This network helped preserve and transmit mathematical learning during a period often (incorrectly) characterized as intellectually dormant.

### Rhetorical Style

The preface is notable for its elaborate **humility topos**—Adelbold apologizes profusely for daring to trouble the Pope with such questions, while simultaneously demonstrating his own learning. This was conventional in medieval scholarly correspondence but also reflects the genuine reverence scholars held for Gerbert's mathematical authority.

The text includes a charming reference to the proverb about "teaching Minerva letters"—meaning teaching an expert something they already know. Adelbold humbly offers his calculations not to instruct the Pope, but to seek correction or confirmation.

## 5. Manuscript Tradition

The text was first published by Alphonsus Hueber from manuscripts at the monasteries of Tegernsee and St. Peter's (Salzburg), and later included in Bernard Pez's *Thesaurus Anecdotorum Novissimus* (1721-1729).

## Noteworthy Excerpts from the Text (Translated)

### On Approaching the Pope

> "It is a serious offense to disturb someone devoted to the public good with private requests. But I have confidence in your genius, that you can simultaneously serve the commonwealth and satisfy me in what I seek."

### On Mathematical Knowledge

> "To find the circumference from the diameter, the diameter from the circumference, and the area from the diameter and circumference... is easy for those who are accustomed to dealing with such matters. But how can someone compare volume to volume who has not yet grasped what volume is?"

### The Core Problem

> "Hence it happens that someone who does not know how the volume of each sphere is constituted cannot understand that one volume is eight times another. But I will reveal what I have already grasped from this, not, as they say, teaching Minerva letters, but to show what I think."

### On Seeking Authority

> "And indeed what I now wish to propose, by what reasoning it can be examined and led to understanding, I seem to see. But I await your careful judgment to determine it, so that the authority of so great a man may either correct or confirm my instruction."
