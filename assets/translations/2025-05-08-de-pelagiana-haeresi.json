It would be shameful to harm even slightly the reputation of such a knowledgeable man, who has provided the Catholic world with exemplary studies for the Church, through his works on the Pelagian History and his efforts in preserving ancient monuments.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        As I reflected on these matters and revisited Photius' testimony, I was inclined to think that the views of both writers could be easily reconciled. This is particularly because Photius never states that while Leo was in Rome, Prosper wrote those pamphlets against the Pelagians. He simply mentions:\n        <s>\n            \"Prosper, truly a divine man, with pamphlets published against them, easily scattered and extinguished them.\"\n        </s>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This way of speaking suggests that Prosper might have taken the opportunity in Rome to publish those pamphlets he may have written earlier against the Pelagians. Anyone who pays attention to Photius' words at 289 will understand this. Additionally, it's important to remember that Prosper wasn't in the habit of sharing his writings indiscriminately. At that time, there weren't enough manuscript codices for them to be widely circulated.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Therefore, it's plausible to think that Prosper, perhaps the author in Gaul according to Noris, eventually published them in Rome to effectively counter the Pelagians. This idea is supported by Jerome's letter to Florentius, which we discussed in the edition of Eusebius. We noted there was a significant exchange of books between Jerome and Rufinus. Jerome earnestly requests Florentius, upon hosting their mutual friend Rufinus, to ensure he sends the commentaries of the blessed Rheticus, Bishop of Autun, on the Song of Songs.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

This oversight should not have been missed by someone aiming to diligently highlight the life and deeds of Leo. However, it's beneficial to set aside these and similar matters for now. We'll address them more thoroughly and clearly when we discuss the titles of Pope Leo's decrees, totaling forty-nine, guided by the authority of Vatican documents.</p> \n\n<p>Now, we need to return to the Pelagians, from whom our discussion has slightly diverged. In the second chapter of that letter, Saint Leo, aiming to curb the unrestrained boldness of the Pelagian clergy and lead them to renounce their wicked doctrine, instructed Metropolitan Januarius:</p> \n\n<p>\"Gather a synod of provincial priests among you, and require all, whether priests, deacons, or clergy of any rank, who have imprudently been received into Catholic communion from the association of Pelagians and Coelestians, without first being compelled to condemn their error. Now at least, since their hypocrisy has been partly exposed, they should be forced to true correction, which can benefit them and harm no one.\"</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, to prevent anyone from harboring the audacious and cunning plan of concealing the vile poison of that heresy under the guise of hypocrisy, and to block every avenue of evasion and deceit, he ordered that they openly denounce the authors of the arrogant error with their own professions. They must detest whatever in their doctrine the universal Church has abhorred, and embrace and fully approve all the synodal decrees that the authority of the Apostolic See has confirmed for the eradication of this heresy, with full and open declarations and signatures in their own hand.</p> \n</speak>",
