For he is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, that is, without intercourse and human seed from the virginal womb, as if cut out of the mountain of human nature and the substance of the flesh (Daniel 2).\n</speak>",
      "original_latin": "Item recapitulatio. Istae generationes coeli et terrae, quando creatae\nsunt in die quo fecit Dominus Deus coelum et terram;\net cum superius septem dies numerati sunt, nunc\nunus dies dicitur, quo fecit Deus coelum et terram,\net omne virgultum agri, et omnem herbam regionis. Hujus diei nomine secundum prophetam, omne tempus\nhujus vitae significatur, in quo coelum et terra\nfactum est, id est, in quo creaturae visibiles dispenuntur,\nadministrantur atque existunt. Sed quid sibi\nvult quod nunc, nominato coelo et terra, adjecit virgultum\nagri et herbam regionis, et tacuit caetera quae\nsunt in coelo et in terra, vel etiam in mari, nisi quia\n per virgultum agri invisibilem creaturam demonstrat\nintelligi, sicut est anima. Dictum autem virgultum,\npropter vigorem vitae; herba, propter eamdem vitam,\nnunquam marcescentem. Deinde quod addidit: Antequam\nesset super terram, intelligitur antequam\nanima peccaret. Terrenis enim cupiditatibus sordidata,\ntanquam super terram nata, vel super terram\nesse recte dicitur. Non enim pluerat Dominus Deus\nsuper terram, et homo non erat qui operaretur terram:\nideo non germinaverat terra, quia non pluerat Dominus\nsuper terram; et homo non erat qui operaretur terram,\nquia maxime propter pluviam et hominem, qui\noperatus est eam, germinat terra, et fructum producit. Unde et adjecit: Nondum enim pluerat Dominus\nDeus super terram, quasi aperte diceretur: Antequam\npeccaret anima, nondum nubibus Scripturarum pluviam\ndoctrinae Dominus ad irrigandam animam concesserat. Nondum propter hominem, qui est terra,\nDominus noster nebulam carnis nostrae assumpserat,\n per quod imbrem sancti Evangelii largissimum infudit. Quod vero subjungit: Et homo non erat qui operaretur\nterram, quia nullus homo operatus est in Virgine,\nunde natus est Christus. Ipse enim est lapis de\nmonte abscissus sine manibus, id est, absque coitu\net humano semine de virginali utero, quasi de\nmonte humanae naturae et substantiae carnis abscissus\n(Dan. II).",
