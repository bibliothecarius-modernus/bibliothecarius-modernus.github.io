He used these stories diligently to curb our youthful impulses and guide us towards the joys of paradise, much like a shepherd using the rod of fear.</p>\n    <p>One day, as he was explaining these matters to us, I, guided by his fatherly wisdom, asked him whether the decline of the monastic order was limited to Italy or if it had similarly collapsed across Europe, and how, in what manner, or when this had occurred.</p>\n    <p>He then began to explain these things to us:</p>\n    <p>Years ago, while the monastic community flourished at the church of Saint Martin in Tours, they started to abandon their ways and customs, spoiling their life and purpose with their own desires. They discarded their traditional clothing in favor of dyed and loose mantles and tunics adorned with cloaks. Their shoes were so colored and polished that they seemed almost glass-like. To avoid stumbling during the nocturnal praises, they would rise with the daylight. These actions, and many others like them, went against the rules.</p>\n    <p>When God decided to bring an end to these matters, one night, while everyone was resting, one monk stayed awake and saw two men enter the dormitory. One held a sword, and the other instructed him to strike them individually with the words: \"Strike this one and that one.\" When the attacker turned to strike the witness, the observer cried out, saying: \"I adjure you by the living God, do not kill me.\" Instantly, the attacker withdrew the sword, and he alone was spared among them all.</p>\n</speak>",
