      "cleaned_english_translation": "<speak>\n    <p>\n        In this situation, there are two errors found in Papebrochius' work: first, Orbati is mistakenly named instead of Optatus; second, the council is incorrectly dated to the year 531 A.D.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Since Clovis passed away in 511 A.D., as we noted earlier, the twenty-second year of his successor, Childebert, brings us to 533 A.D.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Leo, who was represented at the second Synod of Orleans, attended the third one personally. This was held on May 5th, in the twenty-seventh year of King Childebert's reign, according to the signature of Lupus, the metropolitan bishop of the Church of Lyons in the first province, which corresponds to the year 538 A.D., as stated by the authors recently mentioned: Valesius, Cointius, and Pagius. Once again, Papebrochius should be corrected, as he mistakenly dates this synod to 536 A.D.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, the holy bishop did not attend the fourth Synod of Orleans, held three years after the third. This is evident from its twenty-seventh canon, which states: If anyone after the Synod of Orleans held three years before this, etc. Therefore, this council took place in the thirtieth year of King Childebert, which is 541 A.D. Cointius discusses this in more detail and also explains why our bishop of Sens was absent from this council: namely, a dispute between him and King Childebert, as he strongly defended the rights of his Church.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This is clearly revealed in his letter to the same king, which we have published. From it, we learn that the metropolitan city of Sens was under the rule of King Theodobert; however, the town of Melun, which belonged to the same metropolitan seat, was not under Theodobert but instead obeyed his uncle Childebert. Therefore, when Childebert attempted to establish an episcopal seat at Melun, Leo, the metropolitan of Sens, resisted, as that town still belonged to the diocese of Sens. For this reason, King Childebert, having found Leo to be a staunch defender of his rights, did not allow the bishop or his representative to visit Melun.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
