To delve deeper, it's evident that God created rational beings, both angelic and human, with specific attributes: angels have spirits without bodies, while humans possess both a soul and a body. The natural gifts given by God to these rational beings are crucial to understand, as He has elaborated on this before.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    These gifts include the fact that both human and angelic minds naturally possess memory, understanding, will, being, knowing, and wanting.

However, He does not reside there due to the vastness of His majesty or the grace He bestows only upon the chosen and rational beings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        A certain holy and glorious martyr once said about Him: \"The whole world is His temple.\" If he meant the entire world, including heaven and earth, then it's understood that God can be worshiped and adored everywhere. True worshippers no longer worship in Jerusalem like the Jews or on the mountain like the Samaritans, but they worship the Father everywhere in spirit and truth. <break time=\"500ms\"/> (John 4:23).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        But if he was referring to the whole world as the human race, then indeed, the whole world is God's temple. This means that those from the entire human race who turn to God and become His temple are included. Therefore, the same blessed martyr, after saying \"the whole world is His temple,\" added, \"It must be dedicated in our mind, consecrated in our heart.\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Thus, from both common language and the truth of things, Almighty God is said to be everywhere by His majestic presence, but not everywhere by the grace of His indwelling. He presents His majestic presence generally to all creation, but grants the grace of His indwelling only to the chosen rational beings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What is then asserted is that God can be said to be everywhere by foreknowledge, but not everywhere by predestination; and wherever there is foreknowledge, there must be predestination. Who has ever claimed that God is everywhere by foreknowledge, since His foreknowledge is known only to Him?\n    </p>\n</speak>",

Timeo autem ne sicut\n serpens Evam seduxit astutia sua, ita corrumpantur sensus\nvestri, et excidant a simplicitate, quae est in Christo\n(II Cor. XI, 23). Unde et alibi admonet dicens: Ineptas\nautem et aniles fabulas devita (I Tim. IV, 7). Et iterum:\nProfana autem et inaniloquia devita: multum\nenim proficiunt ad impietatem, et sermo eorum ut cancer\nserpit (II Tim. II, 17). Unde et beatus Petrus\napostolus eadem pietate, eadem sollicitudine fideles\nadmonet, dicens: Vos igitur, fratres praescientes\ncustodite vosmetipsos, ne insipientium errore traducti,\nexcidatis a propria firmitate.

LXVIII, 10); qui\netiam flagello de funiculis facto, violatores domus\nDei cum suis mercibus ejecit, eo quod eamdem domum\npaternam fecerint speluncam latronum (Joan. II, 15).

With a pious intention, we should distance ourselves from such individuals so that every faithful person, pure and cleansed in faith, may be worthy of a place in the tree of life. Let's listen to the Lord Himself, who both warns and promises in Revelation: \n        \"The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son. But as for the cowardly and the faithless, the abominable, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death\" <break time=\"500ms\"/> (Revelation 21:7, 8).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        And again: \n        \"Its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. They will bring into it the glory and honor of the nations.

Timidis autem et incredulis, et\n exsecratis et omnibus mendacibus, pars illorum erit\nin stagno ardenti igne et sulphure, quod est mors secunda\n(Apoc. XXI, 7, 8).
