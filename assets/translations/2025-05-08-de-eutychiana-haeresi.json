These words clearly show a true appeal, which is further demonstrated by other words immediately following those praised, which Quesnellus completely omitted to note:\n        <s>\n            \"And to allow no further slander against me by the deceitful ones to proceed, and not to be examined, and to be removed from the number of the orthodox, etc.\"\n        </s>\n        <s>\n            Does he not intend for the full and complete judgment of his case to be reserved for the one to whom he writes and appeals?\n        </s>\n    </p>\n</speak>",

This authority would hardly be appropriate for them as private individuals; therefore, it must be that he gave the petition to them as papal legates, recognizing the pontiff as the appropriate judge for the appeal.</p> \n    <p>He criticizes him for writing in a way that deviates from the rules of jurisdiction and for being unaware of what no one with even a brief experience in the legal system would be ignorant of.</p> \n    <p>Quesnellus then adds that, according to Roman law, the appeal petition should be given to the one to whom the appeal is made, who will then issue letters of dismissal to the litigant.</p> \n    <p><s>Finally, he brings up the example of Paul appealing to Caesar from the governor Festus:</s></p> \n    <p><s>\"He directed the appeal,\" he says, \"to no one else but the governor himself.\"</s></p> \n</speak>",

Can they not summon some or many bishops of the West to join in their concern, revealing and explaining the entire series of matters to them, even using their votes, ensuring nothing is lacking from the solemnity of judgments, which Saint Leo intended to indicate with the writing formula: \"Leo, and the holy synod, which convened in Rome.\"\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        However, of more critical importance is another deception introduced by Quesnellus, which he solely used to diminish and limit the authority of the Roman popes to the narrowest boundaries.

He confidently assumed this ordination would not be rejected by the Roman Pontiff. With the same determination that led him to secure Anatolius's election, he acted quickly so that a council would ordain him. This suggests that the fragment of Anatolius's letter was misplaced in the Quesnellian edition and should have been placed after Theodosius's letter.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Whatever might be said about this very ambiguous issue, I believe it is not relevant to our purpose. Especially since the rights of the apostolic see remained completely intact and were preserved through Leo's careful handling. He hesitated to consent to Anatolius's ordination until he had obtained certain and solemn testimonies about the new bishop's integrity and sincerity of faith, as well as about those with whom he had communion. Therefore, while respectfully dealing with the emperor and maintaining the majesty and authority of the pontifical dignity, he asks the emperor not to be displeased with his hesitation, saying:\n        <s>\n            \"I beseech your clemency to bear this patiently; so that when he has demonstrated himself as we desire concerning the Catholic faith, we may rejoice more abundantly and securely in his sincerity.\"\n        </s>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        To remove any negative suspicion and the cause of the entire difficulty, he seeks to address it by not demanding anything burdensome but invites him to something that no Catholic can refute. He asks Anatolius to recall the doctrine of the Greek and Latin Fathers on the mystery of the Incarnation, by which the Nestorian heresy had already been condemned, and to simultaneously revisit what was preached by Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria, in the exposition of the Nicene faith, which the archives of the apostolic see received from him.\n    </p>\n</speak>",

He wrote letters to the holy pontiff, requesting him to travel East, hold a council there, and decide on matters believed to be beneficial for religion.

This would allow imperial letters to be sent throughout the East, as well as to Thrace and Illyricum, so that all the most holy bishops could gather at a designated place and declare by their decision what would benefit the Christian religion and the Catholic faith, as your holiness, he said, would define according to ecclesiastical rules.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Titianus, the prefect of the city of Rome, delivered this letter to Leo, as we learn from the response that Leo himself sent to the emperor.

P. alloquitur Anatolium:\nPer hos ergo, frater charissime, cum testimonio nostro\n ad propria revertentes dilectioni tuae nostra scripta direximus,\nfidenter orantes ut qui gratia apostolicae sedis\nornantur, etiam favore per omnia se gaudeant adjuvari\n. Non me quidem latet eos qui nodum in scirpo\nquaerunt posse contendere minus aptam esse hanc epistolam\nad nostrum assumptum probandum, ob duras\nillas voces, fidenter orantes, quae judicis auctoritatem\ndedecere videntur. At contentionem dirimit, vel\nlectionum varietas, vel fragmentum quoddam epistolae\nFlaviani ex Vaticana bibliotheca erutum, nondum\npublici juris factum, quod ipsi in sequenti tomo\nexhibebimus. Plerique enim codices, et Grimaneus\nipse, ut Quesnellus ad suae editionis oram scripsit,\nhabent, fidenter hortantes. Deinde duorum presbyterorum\nnegotium in annum 449 rejiciendum est. Et\nquamvis tota integra Leoninarum epistolarum series\ndesideretur, tamen ex unico illo fragmento Flaviani\nepistolae in horum causa scriptae innotescit S. Leonem\nveras judicis partes obiisse; duos illos presbyteros\n Romam venisse rationem de fide reddituros;\natque denique non ex quadam indulgentia, sed re\ncognita atque probata, Leonem eos in communionem\nsuscepisse, innocentesque declarasse. Fragmentum\nquippe illud quod indicavimus nihil aliud in se continet\nquam Flaviani ad S. Leonem relationem de fide\net moribus presbyterorum Basilii et Joannis, ut opportunius\nexplicabimus. Hanc epistolam scripsit S.\npontifex decimo tertio kalendas Julii, paulo antequam\nlegatos ad novum generale concilium institueret, et\nex Urbe in Orientem mitteret."
