Absolutely not. It's not limited to any specific place. The prophetic and apostolic voices, bursting forth, have spread all over the earth with the sound of divine preaching, and the words of the heavenly heralds have reached the ends of the world <break time=\"500ms\"/> <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"ˈroʊmənz\">Romans</phoneme> 2; <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"sɑːm\">Psalm</phoneme> 10.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In fact, it's not even excluded from the heavens or from the supreme and intellectual virtues.\n    </p>\n</speak>",
